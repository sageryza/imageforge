# ImageForge — project notes

## Live app
- **Deployed:** https://imageforge-q125.onrender.com (Render.com, free plan)
  - Hub: https://imageforge-q125.onrender.com/
  - Test Station: https://imageforge-q125.onrender.com/test
  - Picture Book (Miracles): https://imageforge-q125.onrender.com/book
  - Illustrated Zine (Talking to Myself): https://imageforge-q125.onrender.com/talking
  - Gallery: https://imageforge-q125.onrender.com/gallery

## What it is
A hub for making illustrated projects (card decks, picture books, sticker
sheets, zines, single images). Home screen (`/`) is a grid of project types;
each opens a focused workflow that shares the same house styles.

## Stack
- Single-file Node/Express backend: `server.js` (~"v11").
- Static frontend in `public/` (`index.html` = hub, `test.html`, `book.html`,
  `talking.html`, `gallery.html`); shared design system in `public/forge.css`.
- Deployed on Render via `render.yaml`. Env vars set in the Render dashboard
  (all `sync:false`): `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`,
  `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`. Firebase project id: `membry-df528`.

## Image generation
- OpenAI `gpt-image-2` (the zine; single/sticker can also use DALL·E 3).
- Replicate Flux LoRA house styles in `MODELS.replicate` (`server.js`). Each has
  a trigger word prepended to the prompt. A model may pin a `version` hash or
  leave it `null` to resolve the latest from Replicate on first use (cached).
  Styles: Gouache (gosh), Painterly (pnt), Sketchy (special), Book Illustrations
  (vict), Watercolor Drawings (wtr), PWC Scans (tok), **HOONIE** linocut
  (`sageryza/hoonie`, trigger `HOONIE`, suffix "linocut relief print, white
  background", 40 inference steps — applied automatically server-side).
- Committed style previews live in `public/samples/<seg>.webp` (used by the Test
  Station tiles). Regenerate with `node scripts/gen-samples.js` against a running
  server (needs `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`).
- `saveToFirebase()` uploads generated images to Firebase Storage for permanent
  URLs + the gallery; without `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` images are temporary
  (~1hr) Replicate/OpenAI URLs.

## Product pipeline
The full pipeline lives in five self-contained modules wired into `server.js`:
generated design → POD product → **draft Etsy listing** Sophie reviews before
publishing. Each module is a router + exported helpers, decoupled enough to be
lifted into a standalone tool later.

- **`pipeline.js`** (`/api/pipeline`) — orchestration glue. `GET /status`
  aggregates connectivity across every service; `GET /route?product_type=` maps
  a product type to a POD service; `POST /listing-content` AI-writes SEO
  title/13 tags/description (OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini`, clamped to Etsy limits);
  `POST /publish-draft` creates the Etsy draft **and** uploads the design
  image(s) in one call (auto-generates listing content when `generateContent`;
  category comes from a `productType`→Etsy-taxonomy map — `taxonomyFor()` — so
  drafts land in a relevant category instead of inheriting a random listing's);
  `POST /pod-product` creates a Printify product from a design (accepts a
  `product_type` like `t-shirt`/`mug` that resolves blueprint/provider/default
  variant from `POD_CATALOG`, or explicit ids; upload → variants + front print
  area → create, optionally `publish` to the connected Etsy shop for
  auto-fulfillment); `POST /remove-bg` strips a design's background to a
  transparent PNG (Replicate `851-labs/background-remover`) — apparel products
  pass `removeBackground:true` so the art prints clean, not as a filled box.
  Etsy-draft path = manual fulfilment; Printify publish path = auto-fulfils on
  sale (needs Etsy connected inside Printify). Printify products default to
  **draft** (`visible:false`); pass `goLive:true` to publish a live listing.
- **`printify.js`** (`/api/printify`) — POD, wide catalog / lower cost. Bearer
  PAT (`PRINTIFY_API_KEY`), optional `PRINTIFY_SHOP_ID`. Routes: status, shops,
  catalog/blueprints, products, uploads. *Live-confirmed working.*
- **`printful.js`** (`/api/printful`) — POD, in-house quality apparel/cards.
  Bearer account token (`PRINTFUL_API_KEY`), optional `PRINTFUL_STORE_ID`
  (`X-PF-Store-Id`). Has a direct Etsy integration. *Built, not yet key-tested.*
- **`lulu.js`** (`/api/lulu`) — POD, books / coloring books. OAuth2
  client-credentials (`LULU_API_KEY`+`LULU_API_SECRET`), sandbox via
  `LULU_SANDBOX`/`LULU_API_BASE`. Routes: status, cost, print-jobs. Paper maxes
  ~90 GSM uncoated. *Built, not yet key-tested.*
- Card decks (oracle/tarot) are **manual** fulfilment (Robinson Chen) — no API.

### Key loading (env vars OR Firestore)
- `config-loader.js` runs at boot (after Firebase init) and hydrates
  `process.env` from a single Firestore doc (default `config/pipeline`,
  overridable via `PIPELINE_CONFIG_DOC`). **Host env vars always win** — a key
  already in the environment is never overwritten; Firestore only fills gaps.
- The pipeline routers are mounted **inside** the loader's `.then()`, so the
  service modules capture their keys *after* hydration (brief startup window
  where `/api/*` pipeline routes 404).
- Mirrors the sibling repo's `config/*` pattern. Populate the doc with
  `node scripts/set-pipeline-keys.js` (needs `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` + the
  keys in the environment; writes only key names to the log, never values).
- So keys can live in Render env vars, all in Firestore, or a mix.

## Movies (the newest medium — iOS is the frontend)
- `movies.js` (`/api/movies`) — story → movie pipeline, validated end-to-end in
  a July 2026 prototyping run (~$1.35 for a 12-scene film with dream bridges).
  **No web page** — the native iOS app (`ios/`, Movies tab) is the frontend.
- **Pipeline:** GPT breaks the story into ~8-12 SELF-CONTAINED scenes (each
  prompt renders alone — the video model can't infer beats between scenes),
  deliberately creating before/after panel pairs and repeating character
  continuity tokens in every prompt → gpt-image-2 panels (1024x1536,
  medium-quality storyboard first, HIGH re-render for keepers) → Replicate
  image-to-video per scene → ffmpeg edits + stitch.
- **Video tiers:** draft `wan-video/wan-2.2-i2v-fast` (480p, ~$0.06/clip,
  `last_image` conditioning animates BETWEEN the two panels of a pair);
  quality `kwaivgi/kling-v2.1` standard 720p $0.25 / pro 1080p $0.55
  (`end_image` requires pro). Versions pinned in `VIDEO_MODELS`.
- **Dream mode:** bridge clips over every hard cut — start = previous clip's
  last frame (ffmpeg `-sseof` extract), end = next panel, num_frames 121 and an
  AI-written prompt describing one continuous PHYSICAL action (short morphs
  between different compositions read as a jarring leap).
- **Editing is first-class and free:** per-scene trim / speed / freeze / fade /
  drop / reorder, all server-side ffmpeg at stitch time, re-stitch in seconds.
  ffmpeg comes from `ffmpeg-static`/`ffprobe-static` npm packages (or
  `FFMPEG_PATH`/`FFPROBE_PATH`/PATH).
- **State:** one Firestore doc per movie (`forge-movies` collection) — story,
  scenes, prompts, panel/clip URLs, edit list, running job — so movies reopen
  and re-edit later. Long steps run as background jobs recorded in the doc;
  clients poll `GET /api/movies/:id`. Same `STUDIO_TOKEN` gate as the pipeline
  (only `GET /status` open). Panels/clips/films are saved to Firebase Storage
  (Replicate URLs expire ~1hr).
- **Replicate gotchas baked in:** 429 retry with exponential backoff on create,
  download retries + size verification (replicate.delivery truncates under
  parallel load), ~5-parallel prediction pool.
- **Style reference:** `refs/movie-style.jpg` (Sophie's hand-drawn diary-comic
  page, never web-served). When present, EVERY panel renders via gpt-image-2's
  **edits** endpoint with it attached as a pure STYLE reference (prefix insists
  style only — never content/subjects/composition). `MOVIE_STYLE_REF=0`
  disables; without the file, panels fall back to the text `imageStyle` lock.
- **Character anchor** (OpenAI cookbook technique — fixes wardrobe drift): the
  breakdown marks ~3 `key` scenes; the app's character-first flow renders just
  those, then `POST /:id/anchor {sceneId}` locks one panel as the character's
  definitive look. Every later render (panels, grids, zine pages) attaches the
  anchor as an extra `image[]` reference with the preserve-list restated
  ("same face, hairstyle, clothing … Do not redesign the character"). The
  breakdown's `characters` tokens must include hair + face + exact outfit.
  `panelQuality` on the movie (set at creation via the app's Storyboard menu)
  is the default for all panel renders. Validated live: checkered flannel held
  across scenes.
- **Gallery:** re-rolls are never lost — superseded generations go to
  `scene.panelHistory`/`clipHistory` (capped 12, each with `promptUsed`); every
  stitch is kept in `movie.cuts[]`, auto-named by diffing edits/sequence vs the
  previous cut ("trimmed sc 3, slowed sc 7"), with an ordered `frames[]`
  snapshot the iOS Gallery renders as a comic-panel contact sheet.
- **Quick animate:** `POST /api/movies/animate` — one image (data URL) → one
  wan clip, default **720p** (~$0.16); its own polled docs in `forge-quick`
  (`GET /quick`, `GET/DELETE /quick/:id`). Home-screen "Animate one image" in
  the app.
- **The zine:** `POST /api/movies/:id/zine` — the same scenes as a printed
  medium: a hand-lettered cover + one captioned 2x2 page per four scenes
  (captions = scene titles, rendered in the style reference's own lettering;
  validated live — text spells exactly at medium). ~$0.06/page. Lands in
  `movie.zine` (prior zines in `zineHistory`, capped 3). Lulu print step is
  the planned follow-up (`lulu.js` keys are live; a 32-page standard-color
  uncoated paperback ≈ $3.40/copy, saddle-stitch premium ≈ $4.34-7.11).

## Songs (phone recording → real song, keeping the real voice)
- `songs.js` (`/api/songs`, page at `/song`) — Sophie sings a made-up song into
  her phone; out comes a produced track with HER actual voice (built because
  Suno-style covers replace the singer). Pipeline: **resemble-enhance**
  (Replicate, `denoise_flag:true`) strips background noise + restores the vocal
  → **meta/musicgen** `stereo-melody-large` writes an instrumental that follows
  the cleaned vocal's melody (`input_audio` conditioning, `continuation:false`)
  → **ffmpeg** mixes voice over instrumental (adjustable gains, `loudnorm` to
  -14 LUFS) into a 192k mp3. Version hashes pinned in `AUDIO_MODELS`.
- MusicGen holds a melody for ~30s, so longer recordings are cut into ≤30s
  chunks, generated with ONE shared seed (cohesion), padded/trimmed back to
  exact chunk length (`conformChunk` — keeps sync with the voice), and joined.
  Max 4 minutes (`MAX_SONG_SECONDS`); ~$0.11 per 30s chunk + ~$0.03 enhance.
- Uploads arrive as data URLs, are transcoded to mono 44.1k WAV first
  (`toWav` — voice memos are m4a, browser recordings webm), and Firebase
  Storage is REQUIRED (Replicate must fetch the audio by URL). The style
  prompt always gets `STYLE_SUFFIX` ("instrumental backing track, no vocals")
  or MusicGen sings its own oohs.
- Re-mix (gains) is free ffmpeg; re-rolling the instrumental with a new style
  re-runs only MusicGen + mix. Old mixes go to `mixHistory` (capped 12).
- State: movies.js pattern — one Firestore doc per song (`forge-songs`),
  background jobs recorded in the doc, clients poll `GET /api/songs/:id`. Same
  `STUDIO_TOKEN` gate (only `GET /status` open); `/song` served via
  `serveGated` like `/photo`.

## Photo → Etsy pipeline (no POD)
- `photostudio.js` (`/api/photostudio`, page at `/photo`) is a **separate track**
  from the POD pipeline for items Sophie already MADE (a handmade pouch, a
  ceramic, a print she ships herself). One photo of the real product →
  reviewable Etsy draft. No Printify/Printful/Lulu, no auto-fulfilment.
- **Flow:** `POST /describe` (gpt-4o vision → name/summary/category/materials/
  colors/keywords + 3 staging ideas); `POST /mockups` (gpt-image-2 **edits**
  endpoint with `input_fidelity:high` so the ACTUAL product is preserved, not
  hallucinated — a clean white-background shot + up to 2 styled flatlays, saved
  to Firebase as PNGs); `POST /analyze` (describe + write listing content in one
  call, reuses `pipeline.generateListingContent`); `POST /draft` (derives Etsy
  shipping/return/readiness/taxonomy defaults from an active listing, then
  reuses `pipeline.publishDraft` to create the DRAFT with the mockups attached).
- Mockups need Firebase (permanent public URLs Etsy can fetch); without it they
  fall back to data URLs and the `/draft` step refuses them. Same `STUDIO_TOKEN`
  gate as the POD pipeline (only `GET /status` is open).

## Etsy module
- `etsy.js` is a self-contained Etsy Open API v3 module mounted at `/api/etsy`
  (`server.js`). Terminal step of the product pipeline: generated design →
  POD product → **draft Etsy listing** Sophie reviews before publishing.
- **Two auth tiers.** App-level reads (ping, taxonomy) send
  `x-api-key: <ETSY_API_KEY>:<ETSY_SHARED_SECRET>` — the keystring AND shared
  secret joined by a colon (keystring alone → 403 "Shared secret is required").
  Writes (draft listings, image upload) need OAuth 2.0 + PKCE with scopes
  `listings_r`/`listings_w`/`transactions_r`/`shops_r`; access tokens expire
  hourly and auto-refresh. Widening `SCOPES` requires a one-time re-auth at
  `/api/etsy/connect` — stored tokens keep the scopes they were minted with.
- **Routes:** `GET /api/etsy/ping` (health), `GET /api/etsy/status`,
  `GET /api/etsy/connect` (start OAuth), `GET /api/etsy/callback`,
  `GET /api/etsy/me`, `POST /api/etsy/listings/draft`,
  `POST /api/etsy/listings/state` (revert a live listing to draft/inactive),
  `GET/PUT /api/etsy/listings/:id/inventory` (read/set variations),
  `POST /api/etsy/listings/:id/images` (copy an image onto a listing by URL),
  `DELETE /api/etsy/listings/:id` (delete a draft/inactive listing).
- **Variations** live on Etsy's listing INVENTORY endpoint, not the listing.
  `buildBundleInventory(tiers)` builds a single-property "buy N" price ladder
  (custom property 513, `price_on_property`); the PUT route also accepts a
  `{ tiers:[{label,price,quantity?}] }` shorthand. A PUT REPLACES all inventory.
- **Env vars** (Render dashboard, `sync:false`): `ETSY_API_KEY`,
  `ETSY_SHARED_SECRET`, optional `ETSY_REDIRECT_URI`. The callback URL must be
  registered on the Etsy app; defaults to `<RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL>/api/etsy/callback`.
- **Listing rules:** title ≤140 chars, ≤13 tags each ≤20 chars (enforced in
  `validateTags`), `who_made:"i_did"`, `when_made:"2020_2026"`, `legacy=false`
  on writes. Etsy bans apps after 6 months of inactivity — keep it warm.
- **Shop Report** (`etsy-report.js`, `/api/etsy/report`, page at `/report`) —
  shop intelligence from live data: pulls active listings + receipts (windowed
  by `?days=`, default 90) + reviews, cross-references lifetime views/favorites
  vs windowed sales, and buckets listings into top sellers / hidden gems (high
  conversion, low views → visibility problem) / stalled (views, no sales) /
  sale candidates (favorites = Etsy-notified audience) / ad candidates (proven
  converters). gpt-4o-mini writes a short advice section (`?advice=0` skips).
  Same `STUDIO_TOKEN` gate; page uses `serveGated`. If the stored token
  predates `transactions_r` the report degrades to listings-only with a
  reconnect banner instead of failing.
- OAuth tokens persist to **Firestore** (`config/etsy-tokens`, override via
  `ETSY_TOKENS_DOC`) when Firebase is available, so they survive Render
  redeploys / cold restarts. Falls back to gitignored `.etsy-tokens.json` when
  Firebase isn't initialized (local dev). So a one-time `/connect` authorization
  sticks across deploys instead of being wiped each time.

## Design rules (forever)
- **NO GRADIENTS. Ever.** Sophie hates gradients — flat solid colors only, in
  every UI (iOS, web pages, artifacts). No LinearGradient, no CSS gradients.
- **No pills.** Text buttons are rounded rectangles — `border-radius: 6px`.
  Circular icon buttons (toggles, dots) are the only exception.
- **Always use full clickable links** in updates — app pages, the deployed URL,
  PRs — never bare text the user has to assemble.
- **Always include clickable testing links** when something is ready to test:
  the deployed page for the feature plus the PR link.
- **Copy-paste / handoff messages = one code block.** When the user asks for a
  message to copy-paste, forward, or hand off to another chat, put the ENTIRE
  message inside a single fenced code block so it copies in one tap — no
  commentary mixed in, never split across sections or styled headers.
- **No markdown tables in chat replies.** The user reads on a narrow phone
  where wide tables need horizontal sliding and often don't render. Present
  comparisons as short labeled lines or bullet lists instead.
- **Deliverables go last.** When a message includes a generated file — audio,
  image, video, or any downloadable deliverable — send it as the final item,
  after all explanatory text, so it's easy to find and never buried
  mid-message.
- **Long replies get an audio version.** When a chat reply runs longer than
  about one phone screen (~2–3 paragraphs), also attach a text-to-speech
  recording of it — OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini-tts` by default (cheap, reliable).
  Keep it faithful to the text, lightly adapted for listening (spell out URLs
  and numbers). Only render it in the F5 cloned voice when asked.

## Sibling repos
- `memory-library-react` — the games (incl. the Xi card deck), live at
  incaseofamnesia.com; Firebase Cloud Functions that read API keys from
  locked-down Firestore docs (`config/replicate`, `config/openai`, etc.).
- `sage-lora-app` — a minimal standalone Replicate LoRA generator.

## Dev workflow
- Develop on a feature branch, commit + push, open a DRAFT PR.
- **Claude merges its own PRs — always, without asking.** Standing permission
  (July 2026). When the work is ready, merge it, then watch the post-merge
  deploys/TestFlight and fix anything that breaks.
- **Multiple Claude chats work these repos in parallel.** Another chat may
  push, merge, or ship a TestFlight build at any moment — main moves under
  you, TestFlight build numbers race, and code you wrote can get rewritten.
  Re-fetch main before merging, never assume the latest build is yours, and
  re-dispatch from your branch (`imageforge_ref` input) if a main build
  buries it.

## Story Boards (forge-story) — how ANY chat adds projects/assets
The video-project asset boards (Evan, Charlie, Spellcasting, …) shown in the
iOS app (Story Boards tile — a VHS-shelf wall, 3 covers per shelf, tap to open
a project's beat board) and mirrored at `/story` (gated snapshot page).

- **Data:** Firestore collection `forge-story`, one doc per project:
  `{ id, title, order, cover, beats:[{ vo, cards:[{ label, status, url }] }] }`.
  `status` ∈ `ok` (approved) | `cand` (candidate) | `draft` (storyboard
  placeholder) | `miss` (no art yet — omit `url`). `vo` is Sophie's actual
  narration for that beat. `cover` is REQUIRED for the shelf (pick one hero
  shot; without it the case renders as a "?" box).
- **To add/update:** build a manifest JSON (array of projects; use
  `file`/`cover_file` with local paths for any new images — ~700px webp
  preferred) and run `node scripts/sync-story.js manifest.json` with
  `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` (or `FIREBASE_KEY_FILE`) set. Images upload to
  Storage `story/` (content-addressed by basename — reuse basenames to
  overwrite) and docs are replaced wholesale, so ALWAYS write the full project,
  not a partial. The iOS app updates live (snapshot listener) — no build.
- **Clients are read-only** (Firestore rules in memory-library-react allow
  authenticated reads only); all writes go through the sync script.
- **iOS UI changes** (not content) need a TestFlight build: run the
  `ImageForge TestFlight` workflow in memory-library-react (holds the Apple
  secrets; `imageforge_ref` input picks the imageforge branch). The
  imageforge-local `ios-testflight.yml` is a placeholder without secrets.
- Approvals happen in chat with Sophie; sync after flipping statuses.
