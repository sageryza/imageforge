## Dating book — "The Sophie Experiment"
Sophie's long-running dating-memoir project (square coffee-table book from ~50
Portland dates). The full brief, her own planning docs/mockups, illustration
**style prompt formulas**, essay & infographic lists, and prior-chat transcripts
live in **`docs/dating-book/`** — read `docs/dating-book/THE-SOPHIE-EXPERIMENT.md`
first for anything dating-book related. Art uses the `wtr` watercolor LoRA.

## What it is
A hub for making illustrated projects (card decks, picture books, sticker
sheets, zines, single images). Home screen (`/`) is a grid of project types;
each opens a focused workflow that shares the same house styles.

## Stack
- Single-file Node/Express backend: `server.js` (~"v11").
- Static frontend in `public/` (`index.html` = hub, `test.html`, `book.html`,
  `talking.html`, `gallery.html`); shared design system in `public/forge.css`.
- Deployed on Render via `render.yaml`. Env vars set in the Render dashboard
  (all `sync:false`): `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`,
  `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`. Firebase project id: `membry-df528`.

## Image generation
- OpenAI `gpt-image-2` (the zine; single/sticker can also use DALL·E 3).
- Replicate Flux LoRA house styles in `MODELS.replicate` (`server.js`). Each has
  a trigger word prepended to the prompt. A model may pin a `version` hash or
  leave it `null` to resolve the latest from Replicate on first use (cached).
  Styles: Gouache (gosh), Painterly (pnt), Sketchy (special), Book Illustrations
  (vict), Watercolor Drawings (wtr), PWC Scans (tok), **HOONIE** linocut
  (`sageryza/hoonie`, trigger `HOONIE`, suffix "linocut relief print, white
  background", 40 inference steps — applied automatically server-side).
- Committed style previews live in `public/samples/<seg>.webp` (used by the Test
  Station tiles). Regenerate with `node scripts/gen-samples.js` against a running
  server (needs `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`).
- `saveToFirebase()` uploads generated images to Firebase Storage for permanent
  URLs + the gallery; without `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` images are temporary
  (~1hr) Replicate/OpenAI URLs.

## Product pipeline
The full pipeline lives in five self-contained modules wired into `server.js`:
generated design → POD product → **draft Etsy listing** Sophie reviews before
publishing. Each module is a router + exported helpers, decoupled enough to be
lifted into a standalone tool later.

- **`pipeline.js`** (`/api/pipeline`) — orchestration glue. `GET /status`
  aggregates connectivity across every service; `GET /route?product_type=` maps
  a product type to a POD service; `POST /listing-content` AI-writes SEO
  title/13 tags/description (OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini`, clamped to Etsy limits);
  `POST /publish-draft` creates the Etsy draft **and** uploads the design
  image(s) in one call (auto-generates listing content when `generateContent`;
  category comes from a `productType`→Etsy-taxonomy map — `taxonomyFor()` — so
  drafts land in a relevant category instead of inheriting a random listing's);
  `POST /pod-product` creates a Printify product from a design (accepts a
  `product_type` like `t-shirt`/`mug` that resolves blueprint/provider/default
  variant from `POD_CATALOG`, or explicit ids; upload → variants + front print
  area → create, optionally `publish` to the connected Etsy shop for
  auto-fulfillment); `POST /remove-bg` strips a design's background to a
  transparent PNG (Replicate `851-labs/background-remover`) — apparel products
  pass `removeBackground:true` so the art prints clean, not as a filled box.
  Etsy-draft path = manual fulfilment; Printify publish path = auto-fulfils on
  sale (needs Etsy connected inside Printify). Printify products default to
  **draft** (`visible:false`); pass `goLive:true` to publish a live listing.
- **`printify.js`** (`/api/printify`) — POD, wide catalog / lower cost. Bearer
  PAT (`PRINTIFY_API_KEY`), optional `PRINTIFY_SHOP_ID`. Routes: status, shops,
  catalog/blueprints, products, uploads. *Live-confirmed working.*
- **`printful.js`** (`/api/printful`) — POD, in-house quality apparel/cards.
  Bearer account token (`PRINTFUL_API_KEY`), optional `PRINTFUL_STORE_ID`
  (`X-PF-Store-Id`). Has a direct Etsy integration. *Built, not yet key-tested.*
- **`lulu.js`** (`/api/lulu`) — POD, books / coloring books. OAuth2
  client-credentials (`LULU_API_KEY`+`LULU_API_SECRET`), sandbox via
  `LULU_SANDBOX`/`LULU_API_BASE`. Routes: status, cost, print-jobs. Paper maxes
  ~90 GSM uncoated. *Built, not yet key-tested.*
- Card decks (oracle/tarot) print at **MakePlayingCards (MPC)** — no POD API, so
  fulfilment is semi-automated (see `docs/mpc-fulfillment.md`). After an order
  lands, `scripts/mpc_order_builder.py` turns a folder of card images (fronts/ +
  a shared `back.png` or per-card backs/) into an MPC Autofill `order.xml`
  (local-files dialect: `<sourceType>Local File</sourceType>`, comma-separated
  `<slots>`, exact stock strings). The maintained community **MPC Autofill**
  desktop tool (`autofill --directory my_deck`) then drives the browser upload
  and auto-saves the project; Sophie reviews it in her MPC account and checks
  out by hand. Bulk tiers are **per design** (one order = one deck × qty), so the
  default is **one deck at a time / made-to-order**; batch a 6-pack (tier 2)
  only for a proven repeat seller. `scripts/mpc_card_prep.py` (Pillow) is the
  press-ready prep step run BEFORE the order builder — raw art → 825×1125 px @ 300
  DPI incl. 1/8" bleed (cover/extend/fit modes, deck-folder aware, optional
  trim/safe proof images, low-res warnings). Because the pipeline's card images
  live as **URLs** (Firebase/Replicate), not files on a computer, `mpc.js`
  (`/api/mpc`, `POST /prep-order`) is the cloud version of both scripts: it preps
  from URLs + builds order.xml + bundles a downloadable **ZIP** hand-off (sharp +
  jszip; STUDIO_TOKEN-gated; returns a Firebase link). The only step still needing
  a computer is the desktop tool's browser upload — OR use `mpc-upload.js`
  (`/api/mpc-upload`), the full auto-upload: a headless Playwright browser logs
  into MPC, creates the project, uploads every prepped card, sets options, and
  stops at the **cart** for Sophie to review + pay (payment never automated; a
  payment-page guard hard-stops). Background job with per-step screenshots
  (`POST /api/mpc-upload` → poll `GET /api/mpc-upload/:id`); creds via
  `MPC_EMAIL`/`MPC_PASSWORD`. Two caveats: it needs a browser-capable host (NOT
  the Render free web service; `playwright` is an optionalDependency, route
  dormant/501 there), and the MPC selectors (`DEFAULT_FLOW`) need a live
  calibration pass — the engine is mock-tested, the selectors aren't. The ZIP
  hand-off stays the robust fallback; Robinson Chen remains the manual
  hand-fulfilment fallback.

### Key loading (env vars OR Firestore)
- `config-loader.js` runs at boot (after Firebase init) and hydrates
  `process.env` from a single Firestore doc (default `config/pipeline`,
  overridable via `PIPELINE_CONFIG_DOC`). **Host env vars always win** — a key
  already in the environment is never overwritten; Firestore only fills gaps.
- The pipeline routers are mounted **inside** the loader's `.then()`, so the
  service modules capture their keys *after* hydration (brief startup window
  where `/api/*` pipeline routes 404).
- Mirrors the sibling repo's `config/*` pattern. Populate the doc with
  `node scripts/set-pipeline-keys.js` (needs `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` + the
  keys in the environment; writes only key names to the log, never values).
- So keys can live in Render env vars, all in Firestore, or a mix.

## Card-deck art generator (Midjourney via APIFRAME)
- `apiframe.js` (`/api/apiframe`) generates the deck card art with **Midjourney**,
  which Sophie's original decks used. Midjourney has no official API, so this goes
  through **APIFRAME** (`APIFRAME_KEY`), which runs its *own* MJ accounts and
  exposes a REST API — no personal MJ account is involved or at risk. Base
  `https://api.apiframe.ai/v2`, `X-API-Key` header. **Gotcha:** APIFRAME sits
  behind Cloudflare bot-protection that 403s ("error code: 1010") any request
  without a browser `User-Agent`, so the module always sends one.
- **Routes:** `GET /status`; `POST /generate` (`{prompt}` or `{plant, style?}` +
  optional `aspectRatio` default `5:7`, `styleRef` = a public image URL used as a
  Midjourney `--sref` to lock Sophie's look) → `{jobId}`; `GET /job/:id` polls,
  and on `COMPLETED` mirrors the **4** MJ options to Firebase (MJ CDN URLs expire;
  `?save=0` to skip). `imagine()`/`job()` are exported helpers. STUDIO_TOKEN-gated.
- **No text in the prompt** — Midjourney is unreliable at spelling; the plant-name
  label is overlaid later in prep, not generated. Pricing: 16 credits per generate
  (=4 options), 4 per upscale; ~6–8¢/generate on a paid plan.
- Flow: generate (MJ) → pick 1 of 4 → label overlay + print prep → MPC fulfilment.
- **Bring-your-own-Midjourney** (`ingest.js`, `/api/ingest`, page at `/import`):
  the alternate art path — Sophie generates in her *own* MJ account and bulk-
  downloads keepers by keyword with a browser export tool (that step runs on her
  computer; the server can't automate MJ's download — no API, her account, needs
  a browser). This module automates everything after: `POST /upload`
  (`{batch, keyword?, images:[dataURL|url]}` → Firebase `ingest/<batch>/`, filename
  keyword-tagged), `POST /upload-zip?batch=&keyword=` (the raw .zip as the request
  body → unzips server-side and ingests every image, skipping `__MACOSX`/non-image
  junk — so a bulk MJ export uploads in one shot, phone or desktop),
  `GET /batch/:batch?keyword=` (list a batch, keyword = filename substring filter),
  `GET /batches`. The `/import` page (serveGated) is a phone/desktop uploader
  (individual images or a whole ZIP). Batches feed the same review → prep → MPC flow. Trade-off vs
  APIFRAME: own-account is cheaper (flat MJ sub, exact personal style) but manual +
  computer-bound; APIFRAME is fully cloud-automated (~7¢/img). Claude reviewing a
  batch and picking the on-style option is the shared payoff of both paths.
  - **`browser-extension/`** (Chrome MV3, "Send to Deck Factory") kills the
    export/import friction: a floating button on midjourney.com grabs the page's
    MJ images and POSTs them straight to `/api/ingest/upload` (runs in Sophie's
    own logged-in session — no MJ password, no server-side MJ automation). Load
    unpacked; set the app URL + STUDIO_TOKEN + batch/keyword in the popup. The
    image-grab (`collectMidjourneyImageUrls`/`toFullRes` in `content.js`) needs a
    first-run calibration pass against MJ's live DOM (it logs what it finds).

## Movies (the newest medium — iOS is the frontend)
- `movies.js` (`/api/movies`) — story → movie pipeline, validated end-to-end in
  a July 2026 prototyping run (~$1.35 for a 12-scene film with dream bridges).
  **No web page** — the native iOS app (`ios/`, Movies tab) is the frontend.
- **Pipeline:** GPT breaks the story into ~8-12 SELF-CONTAINED scenes (each
  prompt renders alone — the video model can't infer beats between scenes),
  deliberately creating before/after panel pairs and repeating character
  continuity tokens in every prompt → gpt-image-2 panels (1024x1536,
  medium-quality storyboard first, HIGH re-render for keepers) → Replicate
  image-to-video per scene → ffmpeg edits + stitch.
- **Video tiers:** draft `wan-video/wan-2.2-i2v-fast` (480p, ~$0.06/clip,
  `last_image` conditioning animates BETWEEN the two panels of a pair);
  quality `kwaivgi/kling-v2.1` standard 720p $0.25 / pro 1080p $0.55
  (`end_image` requires pro). Versions pinned in `VIDEO_MODELS`.
- **Dream mode:** bridge clips over every hard cut — start = previous clip's
  last frame (ffmpeg `-sseof` extract), end = next panel, num_frames 121 and an
  AI-written prompt describing one continuous PHYSICAL action (short morphs
  between different compositions read as a jarring leap).
- **Editing is first-class and free:** per-scene trim / speed / freeze / fade /
  drop / reorder, all server-side ffmpeg at stitch time, re-stitch in seconds.
  ffmpeg comes from `ffmpeg-static`/`ffprobe-static` npm packages (or
  `FFMPEG_PATH`/`FFPROBE_PATH`/PATH).
- **State:** one Firestore doc per movie (`forge-movies` collection) — story,
  scenes, prompts, panel/clip URLs, edit list, running job — so movies reopen
  and re-edit later. Long steps run as background jobs recorded in the doc;
  clients poll `GET /api/movies/:id`. Same `STUDIO_TOKEN` gate as the pipeline
  (only `GET /status` open). Panels/clips/films are saved to Firebase Storage
  (Replicate URLs expire ~1hr).
- **Replicate gotchas baked in:** 429 retry with exponential backoff on create,
  download retries + size verification (replicate.delivery truncates under
  parallel load), ~5-parallel prediction pool.
- **Style reference:** `refs/movie-style.jpg` (Sophie's hand-drawn diary-comic
  page, never web-served). When present, EVERY panel renders via gpt-image-2's
  **edits** endpoint with it attached as a pure STYLE reference (prefix insists
  style only — never content/subjects/composition). `MOVIE_STYLE_REF=0`
  disables; without the file, panels fall back to the text `imageStyle` lock.
- **Character anchor** (OpenAI cookbook technique — fixes wardrobe drift): the
  breakdown marks ~3 `key` scenes; the app's character-first flow renders just
  those, then `POST /:id/anchor {sceneId}` locks one panel as the character's
  definitive look. Every later render (panels, grids, zine pages) attaches the
  anchor as an extra `image[]` reference with the preserve-list restated
  ("same face, hairstyle, clothing … Do not redesign the character"). The
  breakdown's `characters` tokens must include hair + face + exact outfit.
  `panelQuality` on the movie (set at creation via the app's Storyboard menu)
  is the default for all panel renders. Validated live: checkered flannel held
  across scenes.
- **Gallery:** re-rolls are never lost — superseded generations go to
  `scene.panelHistory`/`clipHistory` (capped 12, each with `promptUsed`); every
  stitch is kept in `movie.cuts[]`, auto-named by diffing edits/sequence vs the
  previous cut ("trimmed sc 3, slowed sc 7"), with an ordered `frames[]`
  snapshot the iOS Gallery renders as a comic-panel contact sheet.
- **Quick animate:** `POST /api/movies/animate` — one image (data URL) → one
  wan clip, default **720p** (~$0.16); its own polled docs in `forge-quick`
  (`GET /quick`, `GET/DELETE /quick/:id`). Home-screen "Animate one image" in
  the app.
- **The zine:** `POST /api/movies/:id/zine` — the same scenes as a printed
  medium: a hand-lettered cover + one captioned 2x2 page per four scenes
  (captions = scene titles, rendered in the style reference's own lettering;
  validated live — text spells exactly at medium). ~$0.06/page. Lands in
  `movie.zine` (prior zines in `zineHistory`, capped 3). Lulu print step is
  the planned follow-up (`lulu.js` keys are live; a 32-page standard-color
  uncoated paperback ≈ $3.40/copy, saddle-stitch premium ≈ $4.34-7.11).
- **Dreams (dream → comic):** the dream-illustration path — replicates the
  daily "get my dream illustrated" experience. `POST /api/movies/dream` is the
  free breakdown: a dream's text → `dreamBreakdown()` (gpt-4o-mini decides how
  many BEATS the dream needs — no padding, most are short — and for each writes
  a self-contained panel prompt + a short caption in the dreamer's own voice,
  minimal prompting) → a `forge-dreams` doc; nothing is drawn yet. The breakdown
  also reconstructs the dream's TRUE chronology from the dreamer's cues ("that
  was before", "at first") and returns the beats already in order; the iOS
  "check the chronology" step lets Sophie hand-tweak that order (▲▼) and
  `POST .../render` accepts an `order:[beatId]` to draw in the confirmed sequence.
  `POST /api/movies/dream/:id/render` then draws the beats as hand-lettered
  2x2 comic pages through the SAME style-ref zine engine — `makeDreamPages`
  packs beats **four per image** (an 8-beat dream = two pages; a short tail
  page lays out with fewer), captions = the beats' own lines (no cover),
  ~$0.06/page. Own polled docs (`GET /dream`, `GET/DELETE /dream/:id`),
  background job on the doc, `pageHistory` capped 3. Separate collection so
  dreams never clutter the movies list. **Character anchor**: if the dream has
  a recurring figure (`characters` tokens), the render first draws it as a solo
  reference and locks it (`ensureDreamAnchor`), then pins every page to it (via
  `panelRefs`) so the same face/hair/clothes hold across pages instead of
  drifting; `POST .../render {reanchor:true}` re-rolls the look. Same
  `STUDIO_TOKEN` gate. No web page — iOS is the intended frontend, like the
  rest of movies.

## Songs (phone recording → real song, keeping the real voice)
- `songs.js` (`/api/songs`, page at `/song`) — Sophie sings a made-up song into
  her phone; out comes a produced track with HER actual voice (built because
  Suno-style covers replace the singer). Pipeline: **resemble-enhance**
  (Replicate, `denoise_flag:true`) strips background noise + restores the vocal
  → **meta/musicgen** `stereo-melody-large` writes an instrumental that follows
  the cleaned vocal's melody (`input_audio` conditioning, `continuation:false`)
  → **ffmpeg** mixes voice over instrumental (adjustable gains, `loudnorm` to
  -14 LUFS) into a 192k mp3. Version hashes pinned in `AUDIO_MODELS`.
- MusicGen holds a melody for ~30s, so longer recordings are cut into ≤30s
  chunks, generated with ONE shared seed (cohesion), padded/trimmed back to
  exact chunk length (`conformChunk` — keeps sync with the voice), and joined.
  Max 4 minutes (`MAX_SONG_SECONDS`); ~$0.11 per 30s chunk + ~$0.03 enhance.
- Uploads arrive as data URLs, are transcoded to mono 44.1k WAV first
  (`toWav` — voice memos are m4a, browser recordings webm), and Firebase
  Storage is REQUIRED (Replicate must fetch the audio by URL). The style
  prompt always gets `STYLE_SUFFIX` ("instrumental backing track, no vocals")
  or MusicGen sings its own oohs.
- Re-mix (gains) is free ffmpeg; re-rolling the instrumental with a new style
  re-runs only MusicGen + mix. Old mixes go to `mixHistory` (capped 12).
- State: movies.js pattern — one Firestore doc per song (`forge-songs`),
  background jobs recorded in the doc, clients poll `GET /api/songs/:id`. Same
  `STUDIO_TOKEN` gate (only `GET /status` open); `/song` served via
  `serveGated` like `/photo`.

## Photo → Etsy pipeline (no POD)
- `photostudio.js` (`/api/photostudio`, page at `/photo`) is a **separate track**
  from the POD pipeline for items Sophie already MADE (a handmade pouch, a
  ceramic, a print she ships herself). One photo of the real product →
  reviewable Etsy draft. No Printify/Printful/Lulu, no auto-fulfilment.
- **Flow:** `POST /describe` (gpt-4o vision → name/summary/category/materials/
  colors/keywords + 3 staging ideas); `POST /mockups` (gpt-image-2 **edits**
  endpoint with `input_fidelity:high` so the ACTUAL product is preserved, not
  hallucinated — a clean white-background shot + up to 2 styled flatlays, saved
  to Firebase as PNGs); `POST /analyze` (describe + write listing content in one
  call, reuses `pipeline.generateListingContent`); `POST /draft` (derives Etsy
  shipping/return/readiness/taxonomy defaults from an active listing, then
  reuses `pipeline.publishDraft` to create the DRAFT with the mockups attached).
- Mockups need Firebase (permanent public URLs Etsy can fetch); without it they
  fall back to data URLs and the `/draft` step refuses them. Same `STUDIO_TOKEN`
  gate as the POD pipeline (only `GET /status` is open).

## Etsy module
- `etsy.js` is a self-contained Etsy Open API v3 module mounted at `/api/etsy`
  (`server.js`). Terminal step of the product pipeline: generated design →
  POD product → **draft Etsy listing** Sophie reviews before publishing.
- **Two auth tiers.** App-level reads (ping, taxonomy) send
  `x-api-key: <ETSY_API_KEY>:<ETSY_SHARED_SECRET>` — the keystring AND shared
  secret joined by a colon (keystring alone → 403 "Shared secret is required").
  Writes (draft listings, image upload) need OAuth 2.0 + PKCE with scopes
  `listings_r`/`listings_w`/`transactions_r`/`shops_r`; access tokens expire
  hourly and auto-refresh. Widening `SCOPES` requires a one-time re-auth at
  `/api/etsy/connect` — stored tokens keep the scopes they were minted with.
- **Routes:** `GET /api/etsy/ping` (health), `GET /api/etsy/status`,
  `GET /api/etsy/connect` (start OAuth), `GET /api/etsy/callback`,
  `GET /api/etsy/me`, `POST /api/etsy/listings/draft`,
  `POST /api/etsy/listings/state` (revert a live listing to draft/inactive),
  `GET/PUT /api/etsy/listings/:id/inventory` (read/set variations),
  `POST /api/etsy/listings/:id/images` (copy an image onto a listing by URL),
  `DELETE /api/etsy/listings/:id` (delete a draft/inactive listing).
- **Variations** live on Etsy's listing INVENTORY endpoint, not the listing.
  `buildBundleInventory(tiers)` builds a single-property "buy N" price ladder
  (custom property 513, `price_on_property`); the PUT route also accepts a
  `{ tiers:[{label,price,quantity?}] }` shorthand. A PUT REPLACES all inventory.
- **Env vars** (Render dashboard, `sync:false`): `ETSY_API_KEY`,
  `ETSY_SHARED_SECRET`, optional `ETSY_REDIRECT_URI`. The callback URL must be
  registered on the Etsy app; defaults to `<RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL>/api/etsy/callback`.
- **Listing rules:** title ≤140 chars, ≤13 tags each ≤20 chars (enforced in
  `validateTags`), `who_made:"i_did"`, `when_made:"2020_2026"`, `legacy=false`
  on writes. Etsy bans apps after 6 months of inactivity — keep it warm.
- **Shop Report** (`etsy-report.js`, `/api/etsy/report`, page at `/report`) —
  shop intelligence from live data: pulls active listings + receipts (windowed
  by `?days=`, default 90) + reviews, cross-references lifetime views/favorites
  vs windowed sales, and buckets listings into top sellers / hidden gems (high
  conversion, low views → visibility problem) / stalled (views, no sales) /
  sale candidates (favorites = Etsy-notified audience) / ad candidates (proven
  converters). gpt-4o-mini writes a short advice section (`?advice=0` skips).
  Same `STUDIO_TOKEN` gate; page uses `serveGated`. If the stored token
  predates `transactions_r` the report degrades to listings-only with a
  reconnect banner instead of failing.
- OAuth tokens persist to **Firestore** (`config/etsy-tokens`, override via
  `ETSY_TOKENS_DOC`) when Firebase is available, so they survive Render
  redeploys / cold restarts. Falls back to gitignored `.etsy-tokens.json` when
  Firebase isn't initialized (local dev). So a one-time `/connect` authorization
  sticks across deploys instead of being wiped each time.

## Shopify (Admin API — newsletter audience + blog destination)
- `shopify.js` (`/api/shopify`) is a self-contained Shopify **Admin API** module.
  ONE custom-app token powers two things: pulling the **newsletter audience**
  (email subscribers) and **publishing blog posts** to the store's built-in blog.
- **This is NOT the storefront token.** The site's Buy Button (on
  thepeoplewatchingclub.com, store `cod-god-inc.myshopify.com`) uses the public
  **Storefront** token — products + carts only, cannot read customers by design.
  Subscribers/blog need an Admin custom-app token (`shpat_…`) with scopes
  `read_customers` + `read_content` + `write_content`, created in Shopify admin
  (Settings → Apps and sales channels → Develop apps → create app → Admin API).
- **Three auth modes**, tried in order (Shopify retired legacy admin-created
  custom apps on 2026-01-01, so new stores can't mint a static `shpat_…` token):
  (1) a static `SHOPIFY_ADMIN_TOKEN` if the store still has one; (2) an **OAuth
  offline token** from `/api/shopify/connect` (authorization code grant) — the
  path that actually works for a **Dev Dashboard** app installed on a single
  store; the offline token doesn't expire and is persisted to Firestore
  (`config/shopify-tokens`, like `etsy-tokens`), so one `/connect` sticks;
  (3) **client credentials** (`SHOPIFY_CLIENT_ID` + `SHOPIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`
  exchanged at `POST /admin/oauth/access_token`, 24h token) — kept as a fallback
  but **it silently returns a token with EMPTY scope for single-store /
  "custom-distribution" apps** (Shopify's docs: custom apps must use token
  exchange or the authorization code grant). If subscribers/blogs 403 with
  "requires merchant approval for … scope" and the token's `scope` is empty, that
  is this trap — use the OAuth `/connect` flow instead.
- **Dev Dashboard setup (current as of 2026-07 — verified live; re-verify the UI
  before instructing, it changes):** the store's admin **Settings → Apps → Develop
  apps** now only links out to the **Dev Dashboard** (dev.shopify.com) — legacy
  custom apps are disabled. In the Dev Dashboard app: **Client ID + Secret** live
  on the app's **overview/credentials** page (the `atkn_…` "app automation token"
  there is CI/CD-only and does NOT work for the Admin API — ignore it). App
  **config is versioned**: to change **scopes** or **redirect URLs** you tap
  **Create/New version**, which *copies the current config* (so scopes carry
  over — no need to re-pick), edit, then **Release**. **Scopes must be REQUIRED,
  not "optional scopes"** — optional scopes are not granted and yield an
  empty-scope token. **Redirect/allowed URLs** are in the same version config (or
  under the app's Settings/URLs); the OAuth callback must be listed there. No
  manual "install" step is needed for the OAuth path — visiting `/connect` and
  approving IS the install/authorization.
- **Env vars** (Render dashboard or Firestore config doc, `sync:false`, added to
  `config-loader.js` MANAGED_KEYS): `SHOPIFY_STORE` (e.g.
  `cod-god-inc.myshopify.com`), then EITHER `SHOPIFY_ADMIN_TOKEN` (`shpat_…`) OR
  `SHOPIFY_CLIENT_ID` + `SHOPIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` (for the OAuth `/connect` flow);
  optional `SHOPIFY_REDIRECT_URI` (defaults to `<RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL>/api/shopify/callback`),
  `SHOPIFY_SCOPES`, `SHOPIFY_API_VERSION` (default `2025-01`).
- **Routes:** `GET /status` (reports `configured`/`connected`/`authMode`),
  `GET /connect` (start OAuth), `GET /callback` (verifies state + HMAC, stores the
  offline token), `GET /subscribers` (customers with
  `email_marketing_state:subscribed`, GraphQL, paginated), `GET /subscribers.csv`
  (download for Shopify Email / Mailchimp — actual *sending* is still manual, no
  public campaign-send API), `GET /blogs`, `POST /blog-post` (REST article
  create; `published:false` = hidden draft to review in Shopify admin first).
  Customers via GraphQL Admin API (REST is being retired for customer data);
  blogs/articles via REST. Same `STUDIO_TOKEN` gate (only `GET /status`,
  `/connect`, `/callback` open — the last two are browser redirects).

## Blog Studio (SEO posts → Shopify blog)
- `blog.js` (`/api/blog`, page at `/blog`, hub tile "Blog Studio") turns a topic
  into an SEO blog post and publishes it to the Shopify store blog — free organic
  search traffic to the shop. Built around 2026 SEO reality: target **long-tail**
  keywords (specific 3-6 word buyer phrases, KD low) that big sites ignore and
  Google's AI Overviews can't fully answer, so the click still comes to you;
  organize as topic clusters (a pillar + specific cluster posts).
- **Flow:** `POST /keywords` (topic → long-tail keyword ideas w/ intent +
  difficulty + a pillar/cluster shape, gpt-4o-mini) → `POST /draft` (full post:
  title/meta/slug/tags/HTML body/FAQ/image prompts, ~900 words, gpt-4o-mini) →
  `POST /image` (gpt-image-2 → permanent Firebase webp URL) → `POST /publish`
  (reuses `shopify.publishArticle`; hidden draft or live). Generation endpoints
  are stateless; drafts best-effort persist to Firestore (`forge-blog`) for a
  "recent drafts" list (`GET /posts`, `GET /:id`, `DELETE /:id`). Same
  `STUDIO_TOKEN` gate; `/blog` served via `serveGated`.

## Secretly a Witch (public witchy app)
- `public/witch.html` (page at `/witch`, **ungated/public**) is a mobile-first,
  single-page app with a **fixed bottom nav** (Lucide icons). Its own dark
  mystical theme (inline, not `forge.css`). Reuses the open `/api/generate/*`
  endpoints + a small set of stateless AI endpoints in `server.js`:
  `POST /api/witch/{tarot,spell,familiar,horoscope}` (all `openaiChat`,
  `gpt-4o-mini`; `parseJsonReply` helper strips fences).
- **Five tabs** (Book of Miracles is locked as the **2nd** icon by request):
  - **Today** — computed **moon phase** (synodic calc from a fixed new-moon
    epoch, client-side), a deterministic **Card of the Day** (per-day hash into
    a full 78-card deck built in JS: 22 majors w/ up/rev meanings + 56 minors by
    suit×rank), an optional AI reflection, a daily **intention**, and a
    **moon calendar** (month grid, glyph per day, new/full highlighted).
  - **Miracles** — the Little Book of Miracles ported in full (capture/imagine →
    illustrated pages → read view). Shares `localStorage['imageforge_miracles_book']`
    with `/book`.
  - **Tarot** — 1 / three-card / yes-no draws + AI reading; **save readings** to
    `localStorage['witch_saved_readings']`.
  - **Conjure** — spell/ritual maker (**save to grimoire**,
    `localStorage['witch_grimoire']`), name-your-familiar, and a charm image
    maker over the house LoRA styles.
  - **More** — daily horoscope, Watch/Shop/Follow tiles, About.
- **External links** live in a `LINKS` const at the top of the client script.
  Shop = `secretlyawitch.com` (Shopify), Instagram = `@moonsickbaby`. **Watch =
  YouTube is still a placeholder search** — the channel URL isn't stored anywhere
  (the YouTube token is upload-only scope and can't read the channel), so it
  needs Sophie's `@handle` pasted in.

## Design rules (forever)
- **Research the CURRENT UI before giving click-by-click steps for any external
  dashboard** (Shopify, Render, Google, etc.). These tools change their menus,
  buttons, and URLs constantly, and guessing from memory sends Sophie hunting and
  wastes her time (this rule was earned the hard way on the Shopify Dev Dashboard
  — see the Shopify section). Look up the up-to-date flow (web search / official
  docs), name the exact current labels, and when a deep link needs an account/app
  ID you can't see, say so and ask her to paste the address-bar URL so you can
  build the exact link — don't invent a path.
- **No pills.** Text buttons are rounded rectangles — `border-radius: 6px`.
  Circular icon buttons (toggles, dots) are the only exception.
- **Icons: Lucide line icons, not emoji.** Functional UI chrome — bottom-nav
  tabs, buttons, link tiles — uses inline **Lucide** SVGs (stroke
  `currentColor`, `stroke-width` ~1.8, an SF-Symbols-like clean line look), not
  emoji. Pull exact paths from `unpkg.com/lucide-static@latest/icons/<name>.svg`
  and inline them (CSP-safe, no external requests). Emoji are fine ONLY as
  expressive *content* (moon phases 🌑🌕, a decorative ✦), never as the icon for
  a control. (Lucide dropped brand glyphs like YouTube/Instagram for trademark
  reasons — hand-inline a simple equivalent or use `monitor-play`/`camera`.)
- **Each app may have its own visual identity — don't blanket-copy the warm-paper
  studio look.** `forge.css` (warm paper, `--accent` tan) is the *studio/hub*
  system; public apps can and should diverge. Example: **Secretly a Witch** uses
  its own dark, mystical theme (ink/plum + gold + moonlight) defined inline in
  `witch.html`, NOT `forge.css`. When starting a new surface, pick a palette that
  fits *that* product rather than reaching for the studio tokens by reflex.
- **Always use full clickable links** in updates — app pages, the deployed URL,
  PRs — never bare text the user has to assemble.
- **Always include clickable testing links** when something is ready to test:
  the deployed page for the feature plus the PR link.
- **Copy-paste / handoff messages = one code block.** When the user asks for a
  message to copy-paste, forward, or hand off to another chat, put the ENTIRE
  message inside a single fenced code block so it copies in one tap — no
  commentary mixed in, never split across sections or styled headers.
- **No markdown tables in chat replies.** The user reads on a narrow phone
  where wide tables need horizontal sliding and often don't render. Present
  comparisons as short labeled lines or bullet lists instead.
- **Delivered files/images go at the BOTTOM.** When sending or attaching any
  file or image, place it at the very END of the message, after all the text —
  never before or in the middle. Write the explanation first, deliver last.
- **End every reply with a verbatim audio version.** Generate a TTS (OpenAI
  `gpt-4o-mini-tts`) reading the full message verbatim and attach it at the very
  bottom, under the TLDR and below any images — it is the last thing in the
  message. Strip markdown/URLs for the spoken version; keep the words.

## YouTube auto-upload (witchy video channel)
- Finished videos post straight to Sophie's business YouTube channel as **private
  drafts** — she reviews in YouTube Studio and taps Publish. Nothing goes public
  automatically. Helper: `scripts/youtube_upload.py` (stdlib only, no deps).
  `python3 scripts/youtube_upload.py clip.mp4 --title "…" --description "…"
  --tags "a,b,c" [--privacy private|unlisted|public] [--short]`. Prints the video
  id + a `studio.youtube.com/video/<id>/edit` review link. Importable: `from
  youtube_upload import upload`.
- **Auth** = one OAuth "Desktop app" client + a durable **refresh token**, read
  from env: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `YOUTUBE_REFRESH_TOKEN`.
  The refresh token mints access tokens forever, so no re-auth per session. Scope
  is **upload-only** (`youtube.upload`) — it can post but not read the channel, so
  a `channels.list` call 403s by design. The OAuth app ("Secretly a Witch") is
  published to Production (unverified) so tokens don't expire in 7 days. Re-auth
  only needed if the token is revoked or a wider scope is required.
- **Shorts** need no special call: a **vertical 9:16 clip that is short** is
  auto-classified by YouTube as a Short. `--short` just appends `#Shorts`.
- **Voiceovers** use Sophie's ElevenLabs Instant Voice Clone "Voice A"
  (`voice_id` `TbXVSG5Ejm1c91umIzJN`, needs `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`), model
  `eleven_multilingual_v2`, punchy settings (stability ~0.34, style ~0.45) and
  ~6% faster. Illustrated episodes render panels through the diary-comic style ref
  `refs/movie-style.jpg` (gpt-image edits) then animate with Wan (`VIDEO_MODELS`
  in `movies.js`). See also `what-sage-should-do-at-her-computer.md`.

## Sibling repos
- `memory-library-react` — the games (incl. the Xi card deck), live at
  incaseofamnesia.com; Firebase Cloud Functions that read API keys from
  locked-down Firestore docs (`config/replicate`, `config/openai`, etc.).
- `sage-lora-app` — a minimal standalone Replicate LoRA generator.

## Dev workflow
- Develop on a feature branch, commit + push, open a DRAFT PR.
- **Claude may merge its own PRs without asking** (standing permission, July
  2026). When a PR is ready, merge it — then watch the Render deploy and fix
  anything that breaks.
