# Secretly a Witch — to-do / backlog

A living list of changes for the Secretly a Witch app (web `/witch` + the iOS
shell). Newest ideas at the top; check things off as they ship.

## Open

### Etsy → Shopify product transfer (replace the "Shuttle" app)
Let a chat (or a button in the app) add Etsy listings that aren't yet on Shopify
**into** Shopify automatically — taking over the job Sophie currently does with
the Shuttle app. Right now the app shop mirrors Etsy but can only *show*
products that already exist on Shopify.

- **Blocker — one permission:** the app's Shopify connection is content-only
  (`read_customers, read_content, write_content`). Creating products needs
  **`write_products`** (+ `read_products`). Etsy read access already exists
  (`listings_r`), so that's the only missing piece.
- **Steps:**
  1. **Widen the Shopify scope.** In the Shopify **Dev Dashboard** app
     (dev.shopify.com), create a **new version**, add `write_products` +
     `read_products` to the **required** scopes (not "optional"), and **Release**.
     *(Re-verify the Dev Dashboard UI before doing this — it changes; see the
     Shopify section in the main CLAUDE.md.)*
  2. **Re-authorize.** Visit `/api/shopify/connect` and approve, so a new
     offline token with the product scopes is minted + stored in Firestore.
  3. **Build the transfer endpoint.** Server-side: given an Etsy listing (or all
     currently-unmatched listings), pull its images / title / description /
     price / tags via the Etsy API and create a matching Shopify product
     (Admin API product create + image upload).
  4. **Review before live.** Create the Shopify product as a **draft** so Sophie
     approves it before it publishes (matches how Etsy drafts are reviewed).
  5. **Trigger.** A button in the app's shop (or a chat command) to transfer the
     missing items.
- **Currently missing from Shopify (on Etsy, not shown in the app):**
  - Magic Rituals Card Deck
  - Boo-Boo Doll (healing witchcraft Band-Aid kit)
  - *(A third "Witchcraft Kit" Etsy listing is effectively a duplicate — Sophie
    already has witchcraft-kit products on Shopify.)*

## Done
- Shop mirrors Etsy: order + filter to Etsy items only, clean one-line display
  names (long SEO titles kept on Shopify). *(2026-07-21)*
- Shop tab is boxless (sharp-corner image + text under, no card outline).
